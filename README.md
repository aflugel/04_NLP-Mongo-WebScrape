# 04_NLP-Mongo-WebScrape: Analyzing Theatrical Monologues from MonologueArchive.com
I worked on this project for 2.5 weeks as part of the Metis Chicago 2018 Winter Cohort. This was **Project 4**.
  
We were given free reign to pick our problem and data sources, with two requirements:
1. Prepare and load data into Mongo database on an AWS EC2 instance.
2. Use NLP techniques to analyze text data.
  
----
  
This project is broken into 2 Jupyter Notebooks.
* **[Notebook 1](aflugel04-notebook1.ipynb)** - Scraping MonologueArchive.com and loading into MongoDB.
* **[Notebook 2](aflugel04-notebook2.ipynb)** - Pulling the data from Mongo, data prep, NLP.

----

  *Please note - The AWS instance with MongoDB is no longer running. However, I pickled all of the pulled data [\(df_all.gz\)](/df_all.gz) if you want to walk through notebook 2 and/or play around with the dataset.*
